# How to initiate the game ?

This game works only on Windows unfortunately (since we coded on Windows...). And you have to execute it in a terminal by using either your invite command or cmder (which you can download here : https://cmder.net/ and to execute it, just click on cmder.exe after you've extracted the files from the zip). cmder is the prefered choice for a better experience !

If you don't have mingw32 installed on Windows, here's a good tutorial on how to install it :

To make it work on cmder (or on a windows terminal), put:

```mingw32-make``` or ```mingw32-make exe```
to compile
```bin\exe```
to execute the program

And I stress it hardly but just do backslash not front slash when executing, and also have cmder, it works wonders on windows !
