## Project Description: <a name="projectdescription"></a>

Our job is to make a Labyrinth board game using the C code


## Several days before...<a name="0"></a>
Started the project and we're feeling a tad bit worried about how this'll turn out but that's fiiiiiiiiiiine...

## 08/02/2021 <a name="1"></a>
Fabien gave us a great tool to make a state graph using a coding language called mermaid. FREAKING BRILLIANT!

## 14/02/2021 <a name="2"></a>
Added some new stuff into our graphs and projects

## 15/02/2021 <a name="3"></a>
Finished retranslating everything, also started some pseudocode 'cause our teacher said so...

My god we're doomed...

## 17/02/2021 <a name="4"></a>
Put some additional functions, but to be fair, still having no goddamned idea of where to go with this... But we'll still move forward somehow...

## 22/02/2021 <a name="5"></a>
Added even more pseudo code functions, please kill uuuuuus !!! And with that uplifting message, we wish ya a hell of a good day !


## 25/02/2021 to 26/02/2021 <a name="6"></a>
Guess what ? Today I made progress alone (reluctantly but shut up...) since Rami has fever and thus could not contribute... and the other days we worked more on the other TP for Information Theory...

But you aren't here for out complaints am I right ?
Basically... just added some other functions, updated some other stuff, and replaced some leftover french here and there...

What ? You expected some grandiose pseudocodes, or maybe an actual plan and organization ? Nah, we're too dumb for this kinda stuff... The only we have going for... is to never give up ! (and to do a minimum of something...)

With that, hopefulle tomorrow we'll do more... Well technically today, since I decided to work from 23 o'clock to midnight...
Generally what we do with Rami is the following : I'm the orchestra commander, he's the writter of the code. I'm essentially instructing him on what to do and throwing a ball at the wall to force my brain into thinking the functions (my god there are so many... there's no way in hell we can make them all... right ? No we have the power of BS on our siiide... I think).

ANYHOW, Good night and look forward to our next trainwreck of an adventure !

## 26/02/2021 <a name="7"></a>
Today, with Rami, we did this time about three more functions if I reckon... Not nearly enough but come ooon ! It's sooo damn hard !! But we're still managing somehow... Anyway we basically had an accessibility function, a win function and we modified other functions to fit the need...

That's kinda it... Thank you for reading these lines... if you read them here : a cookie for ya

Ah Sunday, you think it may be a day of rest where you do nothing... WRONG ! There is always something to do ! That something was making a preliminary concept (aka a shopping list of what to have), because we thought it would be better to have one... even though we did some pseudo code and diagrams... YEAH ! We're never tired of being random ! If we decide to make functions today as well, I'll make sure to make an update about it... now I need a snack or something...

## 01/03/2021 <a name="9"></a>

So... One day before we see our good ol' teacher again... I'm kinda scared actually, even if we tried our best, when we see the others we're like "Oh my goood how did they do this ??? They make it look so damn easy !!!".

Anyway the resume of what we did today :

- We did another function called : Orientation (aka ask the player how do they want to orient the tile before putting it back in the thing)
- I helped Rami make another issue for his group (because I did some myself for my group), and at this point we shouldn't call those things issues, more like praises to the gods ! Goddam they're better than us, like way damn organised, there's a clear and concise way to do the functions... It's so damn awesome !!!
- Reorganized the functions of the pseudo code to be more breathable (although they're not yet as breathable as those of the other groups)

And that's kinda it !

Hopefully everything goes well tomorrow, 'cause I know I'm shakin' in my boots... At least we're going to get in there, knowinng that we tried our damn best and we always tried to do something rather than nothing !

Good night folks, have a good one !

## 02/03/2021 <a name="10"></a>

Day 5021 : I've lost count of how many days we've spent in this project... I think I'm turning insane... Wait not yet...

Anyway, today was the day where we met up back with our teacher...

The impression I got from him was : "it's alright".

Which was a good thing, however he did bring up some interesting tid bits :

- We needed to redo our pseudo code (in the sense that the pseudo  code... isn't PSEUDO enough)... so we did !
- He also told us to do a kind of first page for the other dude, so that's the other thing on the menu after this (today was basically juste redoing our pseudo code business)...

Before he got into our zoom call, we just reorganized a list (the list of treasures to be exact)... and that's it, because we had no more ideas brimming inside of our *brilliant* minds !

Anyway, as you may see on the commit, I'm currently writting this at 00:13 of 03/03/2021... Yeah, not quite the best time to do such a thing, but damn it, I'll do it anyway, since apparently he likes this kind of stuff... I wonder what we'll cook up next... Only time will tell I guess.

Now, if you'll excuse me... **I'MMA NAP !!!**

## 05/03/2021 <a name="11"></a>

FINAL DAY FOR THE ANALYSIS REPORT !!!

HOLD ON TO YER PANTS, IT'S GONNA BE A ROUGH ONE  !!!

No but seriously... Today... was... a huuuuuuuuge... mess !!!!

Because we tried for several goddamn hours to transform a markdown to pdf correctly... but to no avail.

I mean... by that I say the  following : We did succeed into making a pdf using a site called https://www.markdowntopdf.com/

And it worked kinda, it did not show our diagram using mermaid code and it did not display correctly the pseudo code... So at least we just this version on the repositery to be safe, if you know what I mean...

Then we tried to download pandoc and use it but then BAM, it says that you need pdflatex in order to transform an md to pdf, so we did... by using miklatex or something, but then it did not work either (plus the download was long as heck)... But apparently we could also do it on said latex the transformation and law and behold, we're back to step 1 of the process... **YAAAAAAAY MY FAVOURITE STEEEEEP**

I can't stress enough of how excrutiating it is, to go everywhere on the net trying to find a solution to the problem, that you may not succeed in...

Then in the night Rami had the brilliant idea to take the pdf result, make it into a word, modify it from there, and finally put an impscreen of the diagram and correct the code that went over the space and that did not load properly and was cut, (so we had to look back on our functions and copy the missing parts).

But in the end we did it !!! And we uploaded the second version as well... Now we're spent and essentially mentally done...

We know for a fact that our document ain't any pretty, but we poured our soul and tears into it... If I had to compare to a sensation or an image, I think the "Dan Hibiki that is calling his dad" image fits the bill to a T :

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/characterprofile/images/7/72/Don_Habuki.png)

PS : As a last ditch effort we also mailed our teacher just in case... But oh well, in the end we tried every kind of solution and built multiple failsafes... only to end up having this as a result... Yup checks out for our group.

Our motto is :
 > Bullshit your way to victory somehow, by any means necessary, with some fun and gimmicks along the way, but especially by not giving up !

With that, we'll wish you a merry week-end !


## 13/03/2021 and 15/03/2021 <a name="12"></a>

Hi !  It's been a while, hasn't it ?

Well here is the gist of things : We had a ton of stuff to do for Information Theory (mainly decrypting codes) and for System Programation, therefore we didn't do much for this project...

However we did not do nothing either, so that's something at least...

We began with the small functions and the structs...

And our teacher says we should give up on the Giveaccess stuff... But then I wonder what we should do...

Eh, we'll find out eventually... Anyway we also interested ourselves a bit with the Unitary tests.

And that's pretty much it !

*Have a jolly Monday !*


## 21/03/2021 <a name="13"></a>

Hi, I'll be honest with you... We kinda did nothing these past few days... The reason being, we are starting to tire out.

"Already ?" You may be asking yourself and the answer to that is yes kinda. Everything is accelerating way too fast as we approach the end of the year/semester, and our small sized brains can't handle that much pressure.

At least here is a good news : **I** figured out a little how makefiles and headerfiles work ! Now I just need to tell Rami about this discovery and everything will go smooth... is what I wish would happen, but it's more like a cruisade.

You can view our little test mumbo jumbo in code_in_c/code_labyrinthe_test_2 where the contents of our stuff is.

Basically you can do makefiles and header files on replit, and then download the whole damn project as a zip folder.

I saw your unicode stuff, and it peaked my interest, I'll have to take a little closer look later.

Finally, maybe we'll see tomorrow with the test functions shenanigans. But as of right now, I'm quite happy with the results (even though I had a huuuuge amount of laziness this week end).

We have like what... Less than 2 months before this project is over with other projects hovering above our heads ? What is the worst that could happen, right ??? (end me pls)

Have a nice night, I'mma nap... Deuces !


## 22/03/2021 <a name="14"></a>

Hello, are you perhaps enjoying a morning coffee ? Or at least some type of coffee (it'll still do the trick).

You may be wondering : "Hey ! Why the date is showing yesterday instead of today ?" Because I forgot that's why !

But tl;dr... I explained to Rami how heeader files work, how makefiles work and after that we took the unity zip and the test to do it (and you can see the result in the test unity folder and more precisely the zip, because apparently git did not add all of the folders (it's missing the 2 folders one of which is unity)).

We did a little tweaking here and there to make the makefile work and changed a few includes (because different files and systems) and law and behold... **IT WORKED ON REPLIT !!!**

And that's about it... Because we had no idea where to put it yet in our code, but at least we got the requirements to do it (plus you can even download zips from replit and essentially take all of the project that you make there in order to be sure that it works).

So what's next in the order of business ? A proper implementation of unity in our damn code, and then a little trip towards unicode box shapes... and you know... *make the entire goddamn project before the 15th of May... no pressure whatsoever, it's gonna be grand and fantastic*.

You know at this point the readme is basically just journal of where the heck we're at... Kind of like a sailing journal, where we just sail through the seven seas and eventually get towards a land of treasures.

And that's about it... Hope you enjoyed today's (yesterday's) news, and we'll see you in the next instalment of *We don't know how to make a project, but we'll do it anyway !*


## 27/03/2021 <a name="15"></a>

Hi, another late report... as usual. To explain briefly... After a lot of hurting head and stuff, we managed to do a unity test !!! (for a pretty basic function that has not real use whatsoever except you know...being a test).

It took some time but hopefully we can use this, 'cause I don't really have an actual idea on how to use it... Meh I guess we'll find a way... somehow.

This project, I swear, it'll be the death of us...

But hey, at least once we finish the last TP of information theory, we should be able to increase the output of this project ! We just have to keep on livin' I guess.

Anyways, good night to y'all... I don't know if this is enough... Personnally I think we could do better, but each and every time the teacher hurls us with another weird thing to learn for ourselves... But it's all for the purpose of making us better programmers, so there's no helping to it...

That's about it !


## 27/03/2021 <a name="15"></a>

Hello... so... we did what today... almost nothing right ? Yeah... we have a probability test comming up (so we revised most of the time, and did a bit of the other projects as well)... and I don't like our chances... The probability of us screwing up is just as high as the one where we finish this project in time XD !!

But tl;dr we modified a function, added a new one and finally did some more unitary tests thing, and I wonder... are we obligated to do unitary tests for each and every freakin' function ? 'Cause if we are, then let's just say that we'll be basically doing 2 projects in one (not to mention the reports to do, and the eventual oral).

In addition, we saw another team (through Rami) and they did their tiles !!! *(I'm a bit jealous)*

Oh well, can't help it... And if you think that we have the time to do this entire project during vacation, you're a bit sorely mistaken... 'cause we're so sloooooow *crieeeeees* !!!!

In the end, we do a little bit out of everything... not sure if it works or not... but we'll do our best !!!

Nightie Night !

## Thank you part <a name="Thanks"></a>

A special thanks to our kind Mods for this suggestion 'cause we're a bit dummy dummy dumb dumb, the groups we supervise because they're an inspiration for us, and also for our teacher for making this project in the first place, I bet we'll learn some cool things along the way...
